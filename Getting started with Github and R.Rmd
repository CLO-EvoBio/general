## Create a GitHub account

If you don't have a GitHub account yet, create one. Remember to activate the account by clicking on the email that you get from github.

## Install Git

Download and install Git: <https://git-scm.com/downloads> Follow your operating system's normal installation process. Note: you will not see an application called Git listed but if the installation process completed it was likely successful.


Eg. for a mac you'll need to install homebrew: paste in terminal (NOT connected to BioHPC)

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

and then install git (also using terminal on mac):

```
brew install git
```

## Now connect Git on your computer to Github using R/Rstudio:

Installing packages

There are several ways to configure Git, including through the command line. We will use the convenient use_git_config() function from the usethis R package (i.e. we'll run the setup from R). We first need to install the usethis package. Type the following in a new script in RStudio:

## setup packages

```
install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)

#When usethis is successfully attached, you wonâ€™t get any feedback in the Console. So unless you get an error, this worked for you.
```

## use_git_config function with your username and email as arguments

```
use_git_config(user.name = "your_username", user.email = "username@example.org")

#note: this is your github user name and email associated with github.
```

## Entering a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

We will first need to create a PAT on the Github website. Make sure you're signed into your GitHub account in a web browser and that you have verified the email address associated with your account.

In your Rstudio console type the following:

```
create_github_token() 

#This will take you to a pre-filled form online to create a new PAT.
```

On the website: 

- Go ahead and just stick with their selected defaults. 

- Give the token a descriptive name (in the NOTE field), because one day you might have multiple PATs, e.g., one that's configured on your main work computer and another that you use from a secondary computer. 

- Once you've added a name in the NOTE field, click "Generate token". 

- You will get a code - As the page says, you must store this token somewhere, because you'll never be able to see it again, once you leave that page or close the window.

## Put your PAT into the Git credential store

There are many ways to get your credential into the Git store. Here, we will use the gitcreds package, which is a dependency of the usethis package, so we installed it earlier.

```
library(gitcreds) 
gitcreds_set()
```

Now you should be all set to get started working with Github.

## Using R to connect to the your repository.

First create a repository on Github for your project.

You should see a green "code" button. Click this button and copy the https url.

In RStudio: 
-   Create a new project in Rstudio 

-   Under Create Project select "Version Control" 

-   Now select "Git" 

-   In repository url paste the url you just copied from Github 

-   In project directory name paste the repository name exactly as it is on Github (in this case btbw-parentage) 

-   Choose where you would like to store this on your computer -    Click create "Create Project".


This should open a new project and populate it with the information already on Github.
